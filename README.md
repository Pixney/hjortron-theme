## Roadmap

## Changelog

### 2017-11-12 - Added Layout setting 
Added a layout setting in `preferences->themes->hjortron theme->preferences` where you are able to choose between three different layout modes. You are now able to choose on a per user level what font-size and spacing you prefer. This setting means more time has to be spent to perfect everything. Would appreciate any issues files when problems are discovered.

### 2017-11-11 First release 
* Styling improvements for files field type
* Change to grid styling
* Improved responsiveness for Iphone 4
* Change to menu behavior. All menu items are per default visible, but you are able to hide the menu to the very left by clicking the menu button.
